# What Made High-Income Programmers?
## About
It is known that the programmers earn a high salary. Through a survey of Stackoverflow(2019) we could find something interesting.
In order to make my article more rigorous, Iâ€™ll use the pandas/numpy to analysis the result.
## Prerequisites
The analysis is progressed in Jupyter Notebook(Python3) environment. In order to make it worked, the packages below should be applied:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib  

## Data Source
The data used comes from the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). 
Bacause of the large size of data, I couldn't upload it to the repository. But you can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV).

I've posted the analysis in Medium: [What Made High-Income Programmers?](https://medium.com/@weixiao917/what-made-high-income-programmers-759808ec5593)
